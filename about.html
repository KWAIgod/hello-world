I am a huge football fan who enjoys cathing NFL games on tv in my spare time. I've always had a love for computers since 
a very young age so it only seemed right to go into a Information Technology. BLazer One Consulting is my way of giving back to the world of technology 
in any way possible. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact my office at 1(800) 555 5544 or email Blazer One Consulting at 
BlazerOneConsult@email.com</p><center>
